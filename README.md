# NYC Data Analyst Salary Predator

link: [https://skillsalary.herokuapp.com/](https://skillsalary.herokuapp.com/)

The goal of this project is to build a web app to predict salary and know what to learn next as a data analyst in NYC.
On the tech side, it allowed me to explore the process to present the data visualization on the website through Flask, Python, 
Echarts.js(JavaScript) and deployed a Machine Learning model online.
