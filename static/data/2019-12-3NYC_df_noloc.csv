The Career Opportunity: You will face interesting challenges and be counted on to creatively determine how best to get your job done. You must value the free exchange of ideas, solicit critical feedback to make your work better, and, above all, find the best solution to the challenge at hand. Along with a keen analytical mind and strong technical skills, you are an excellent communicator. The ideal candidate will also demonstrate strong character, integrity and respect for others.  The successful candidate will have an understanding of the investment management process and what IM firms are seeking from a content set, as well as experience or knowledge of alternative data. The candidate will need to be able to analyze big datasets and should have some familiarity with SQL, R, and/or Python.

The Analytics team is a critical function that supports data-driven decision-making throughout Harry's. The team is the central nervous system of the organization -- we make sure that data flows throughout the company, and everyone has the information they need to make better decisions faster. The analytics team thinks about data and insights from the factory floor in Germany, across our global supply chain, through the marketing we show our customers, to when the customer gets a package at their door or at their nearest retailer.

About the Role

Harry's is seeking an Analyst who uses analytics to generate and deliver insights that will drive improvements, uncover new truths, and enable smart decision-making across our sales channels. In this role specifically, you will be responsible for diving deep into our omni-channel performance. You will help us (1) optimize how we show up on the shelf in-store, (2) maximize return on marketing spend, and (3) understand our customers end-to-end journey across our ecosystem.

Because our business is complex, we need someone with both a strong business acumen as well as excellent technical skills. You'll work with key decision-makers throughout the company, and also share your insights and recommendations with all levels of the business, including our CEO.

Most importantly, we are looking for someone who is a builder and entrepreneur -- someone who is excited about using data and analytics to push the whole company forward.

Here's what you'll accomplish:

Own end-to-end analyses to answer important business questions using data. For example, you might:


Run matched market tests to understand the impact on Harry's and retailer revenue from of various in-store marketing vehicles
Build algorithms to identify, predict, and fix inventory and merchandising issues in-store 

Stand up dashboards, analyses, and tools for our growth marketing partners to understand and optimize the allocation of media dollars across channels and campaigns
Measure how an omni-channel campaign created incremental revenue and profit across DTC, Retail, and other third party channels
Help define how we measure and report out on performance, and regularly track and share the overall performance of the business to drive strategic planning
Support the forecasting team in understanding variance vs. prior forecasts
Identify analytics pain points and inefficiencies, and develop new tools and automated process to optimize and streamline
Be a data-evangelist across the organization, sharing best practices and insights with cross-functional teams 

Background and Experience:


 4+ years of experience as a Data Analyst or Business Analyst, or a background in Computer Science, Statistics, or Mathematics 

 Proficient Technical Skill - You are fluent in writing SQL, Python, or R to query and manipulate datasets, answer questions, and drive end-to-end complete analysis that help accelerate the business. You have a history of creating effective visualizations to clearly drive your point across to various stakeholders using visualization software, like Looker or Tableau. 

 Math Wizardry - You love to geek out on numbers; you have a hunger to apply (or learn how to apply) statistical concepts and optimization models. 

Strong Business Acumen – You think deeply about business strategy and profitability, and have experience translating the business ins and outs into data driven problems. You can proactively identify and investigate potential areas of opportunity with independence. 

 Engaged Analytical Thought Partner – You are excited about partnering with coworkers to figure out how analytics can solve problems. You are skilled in translating business questions into data analysis visions to execute. You are great at communicating in order to both fully understand someone's business needs and to communicate potential limitations of your approach. 

 Tactical Problem Solver – You have experience boiling down medium and large scope data problems into measurable and achievable blocks of work. You have the foresight to identify and dismantle potential roadblocks ahead of time. Furthermore, you're pragmatic: you can identify and work on the most important problems first and you want to find the highest-impact lowest cost solution. 

 Clear and concise communicator – You know how to communicate complex concepts effectively and concisely and are comfortable presenting and debating in large groups. We're looking for strong data advocates who can plug into cross-functional working teams seamlessly and drive cultural pushes for the organization to become more data driven. 

Values that might describe you:


 You like to solve problems - You push yourself to solve problems in novel, scalable ways so that you are never solving the same problem twice 

 You are curious and a learner - You are always seeking to improve yourself and your team, and you love to learn new things while going deeper in the areas you know 

 You thrive on direct, honest, and supportive communication and feedback 

 You are infectiously optimistic - To you, there's nothing more exciting than a new challenge. Hard things are hard, but you don't let that get in the way 

Who you will work with:


 Within the broader Data org, you'll work most closely with the other data analysts on the team, and the data engineers that support our infrastructure 

 Within the larger H' org, you'll work closely with our Retail team, Growth marketing leads, Brand leadership teams, and Finance / Operational Planning teams

Pfizer reports payments and other transfers of value to health care providers as required by federal and state transparency laws and implementing regulations. These laws and regulations require Pfizer to provide government agencies with information such as a health care provider’s name, address and the type of payments or other value received, generally for public disclosure. Subject to further legal review and statutory or regulatory clarification, which Pfizer intends to pursue, reimbursement of recruiting expenses for licensed physicians may constitute a reportable transfer of value under the federal transparency law commonly known as the Sunshine Act. Therefore, if you are a licensed physician who incurs recruiting expenses as a result of interviewing with Pfizer that we pay or reimburse, your name, address and the amount of payments made currently will be reported to the government. If you have questions regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact your Talent Acquisition representative.
